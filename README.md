# Rust-inline Asm To GCC-inline Asm Translation

A tool to translate Rust inline assembly to GCC inline assembly. This was 
written in about a week so it is very unstable and extremely barebones.
It is done as a Proof Of Concept for my attempt at GCC's GSOC 2024 project of 
implementing inline assembly in Rust (gcc-rs).
